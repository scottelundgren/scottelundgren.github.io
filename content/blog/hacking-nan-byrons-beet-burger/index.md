Hacking has had a bad wrap for over 40 years. Yet today Facebook is on Hackerway Way and [Charlotte’s hosted a hackathon for a second year](https://detailedblock.com/2014/04/18/hackathonclt-planned-larger-event-2014/). While hacking still means rule breaking to some, the phrase means a clever solution too.

Food hacking is still a favorite activity of mine because when I’m dining out I’m looking to bring flavors into my own kitchen. In November at a charity event Lyft held at [5 Church](http://http://5churchcharlotte.com/), I enjoyed the beet burger sliders that were among the buffet. It excited me when that restaurant group opened the casual [Nan & Bryon](https://www.nanandbyrons.com/)’s with their Beet Burger as a main course.

Recently I’ve been eating vegetarian dinners and there are only so many times one can enjoy a black bean burger. [Cowbell](https://eatmorecowbell.com/)’s Shankar Burger of curry pinto & faro is pretty unique, but still is mash of ingredients and cooked. The problem with that approach it is that it has a certain mouth texture that can be unsatisfying.

>The greatness of the beet burger is that it is whole, with a resistance for your teeth and great meaty mouth feel

htop and Chrome Dev Tools my normal investigative weapons were set aside to unlock Nan & Byron’s beet burger. First I started doing research. Google searching “beet burger recipe” turned up some [tasty sounding](https://www.greenkitchenstories.com/grilled-beet-burgers/) & [looking](https://www.sproutedkitchen.com/home/2013/3/26/smoky-beet-burgers.html) recipes. But they all boiled down to the same “cook beets, shred beets, add beans, mix, form patties, cook” formula. Unfortunately that wasn’t the mouth feel I was hunting. So I started looking into other ways to cook beets because I’ve never prepared them before. I had no idea what to do to them. Then I found this [beet salad recipe](https://allrecipes.com/recipe/beet-salad-with-goat-cheese/) and how to make this delicious treat became became clear. Enjoy!

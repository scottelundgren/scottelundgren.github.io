Yet today Facebook is on Hackerway Way and <a href=\"https://detailedblock.com/2014/04/18/hackathonclt-planned-larger-event-2014/\">Charlotte’s hosted a hackathon for a second year</a>. While hacking still means rule breaking to some, the phrase means a clever solution too.</p>\n<p>Food hacking is still a favorite activity of mine because when I’m dining out I’m looking to bring flavors into my own kitchen. In November at a charity event Lyft held at <a href=\"http://http://5churchcharlotte.com/\">5 Church</a>, I enjoyed the beet burger sliders that were among the buffet. It excited me when that restaurant group opened the casual <a href=\"https://www.nanandbyrons.com/\">Nan &#x26; Bryon</a>’s with their Beet Burger as a main course.</p>\n<p>Recently I’ve been eating vegetarian dinners and there are only so many times one can enjoy a black bean burger. <a href=\"https://eatmorecowbell.com/\">Cowbell</a>’s Shankar Burger of curry pinto &#x26; faro is pretty unique, but still is mash of ingredients and cooked. The problem with that approach it is that it has a certain mouth texture that can be unsatisfying.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The greatness of the beet burger is that it is whole, with a resistance for your teeth and great meaty mouth feel</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>htop and Chrome Dev Tools my normal investigative weapons were set aside to unlock Nan &#x26; Byron’s beet burger. First I started doing research. Google searching “beet burger recipe” turned up some <a href=\"https://www.greenkitchenstories.com/grilled-beet-burgers/\">tasty sounding</a> &#x26; <a href=\"https://www.sproutedkitchen.com/home/2013/3/26/smoky-beet-burgers.html\">looking</a> recipes. But they all boiled down to the same “cook beets, shred beets, add beans, mix, form patties, cook” formula. Unfortunately that wasn’t the mouth feel I was hunting. So I started looking into other ways to cook beets because I’ve never prepared them before. I had no idea what to do to them. Then I found this <a href=\"https://allrecipes.com/recipe/beet-salad-with-goat-cheese/\">beet salad recipe</a> and how to make this delicious treat became became clear.

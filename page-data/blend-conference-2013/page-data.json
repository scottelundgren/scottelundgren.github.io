I had the pleasure of working with Bermon Painter while he was organizing this event. What attracted me was an interactive driven environment and a multidisciplinary schedule. The notebook handed out to all attendees became full. I’ll do my best to summarize the experience and the longest lasting take aways.</p>\n<h2>Workshop Day</h2>\n<h3>Think Like a Startup</h3>\n<p>It was everything you learn at Startup Weekend compressed into 2 hours and with a twist. Each person listed their own values and those were pooled to create group values. If I had not taken my sabbatical I could not have expressed those values I bring to my work and client projects. With an engineer's mindset, I did struggle with the undefined nature of the product creation. Thru the experience I found creating a product from place of heart is powerful.</p>\n<h3>Service Design</h3>\n<p>I had heard never heard the term before paying attention to <a href=\"https://ptquattlebaum.tumblr.com/post/60645307036/service-design-making-blend-conference\">Patrick’s Quatttlebaum’s slides</a>. It examines operations, culture &#x26; organization for impacts on the customer's experience. Uber (that secretly launched in Charlotte during the conference) was an example. They looked at the taxi/hired car experience. Uber examined what do customers want, what do employees want, what are the operations that need to be in place to please both.</p>\n<h2>VIP Dinner</h2>\n<p>This evening set the tone for the conference conversations I had later. This was going to be the kind of conference many attendees would write up. I found myself wondering how to have something unique thing to write. Asking my table companions what they had been reading was the theme I hit upon for everyone I spoke to.</p>\n<h2>Talks</h2>\n<p>Reviewing my notes of the talks I scribbled down was a lot of practical advice. Sometimes conferences can have a lot of inspiration and not a lot of application. Here the useful chunks here sprinkled like breadcrumbs along the trail. I learned a lot from <a href=\"https://ashedryden.com/blend-conf-keynote-programming-diversity\">Ashe Dryden’s session Programming Diversity</a>.</p>\n<p>I took no notes during Carl Smith’s talk because he's such a great speaker. Just let him tell you about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs0OcvwgpGk\">Your Money or Your Life</a>. The video isn't from BlendConf but it's the same talk.</p>\n<p>He's my favorite client, hands down. How often do you get emails that are all caps that say MORE FUCKING LIGHTNING?\" James White</p>\n<p>This post title comes from James White's talk about being a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXul0Xojci0\">Design Renegade</a>. I was able to find it from another conference. The relevant story starts at the 41:38 mark. As a developer I would say it is more diffult to apply his lessons, but he’s inspiring and entertaining.</p>\n<h3>Become a Better Designer with Side Projects</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Create content with personality</li>\n<li>Put in the work.
